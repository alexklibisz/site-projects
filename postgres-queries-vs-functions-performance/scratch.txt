- create a not-entirely-small postgres database
- create a stored function for querying the data
- write an equivalent query for querying the data
- write a benchmark container that calls the stored function in a tight loop
- write a benchmark container that that calls the query in a tight loop
- wire up some sort of metrics exporter to inspect cpu, network, memory of the benchmark and database containers
